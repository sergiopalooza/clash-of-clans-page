  <h1>Rules</h1>
  <p>There's only two hard rules that will result in being kicked from the clan.
<br />
<br />
1) Must use both attacks in the war (no exceptions)<br />
2) No attacking solely for the War Loot Bonus (no exceptions)<br />
<br />
If you break these rules you find yourself kicked. Worry not, we will give you a second chance if asked. (You must wait for the 24-hr cooldown before you can request back in)</p>

  <h1>Guidelines</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Do not worry about contributing to the defensive Clan Castles. Arrangements have already been made to ensure they get filled.</li>

<li>Try to attack the highest base that you are comfortable 3-starring.</li>

<li>No troll or fake bases during war-prep day allowed</li>

<li>If all of the bases that you are comfortable 3-starring are attacked, make a practice attack on a defeated base. Attacking for loot is not allowed.</li>

<li>Ask for questions or advice if you want an opinion before your war attack.</li>

<li>Don't forget to request for troops before you attack.</li>
