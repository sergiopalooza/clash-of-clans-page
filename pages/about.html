   Hi, we're Sergio and Erica. This clan was established in March of 2015 when Erica got Sergio hooked on the mobile game Clash of Clans, even though he kept saying "no this game is boring and I don't want to play". We have a few rules and expectations but at the end of the day we're just trying to have fun. We're pretty laid back but we provide consistency and structure that many clans lack. Come check us out in the clan search under DEFEND POP PUNK or Clan tag: #JQUCVOC</p>
