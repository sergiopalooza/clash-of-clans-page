  <h1>Open War (Tuesday 6:00pm CDT):</h1>
  <p>Everyone in the clan who is opted-in to will be brought in our Tuesday war. This is a great chance for all new members to show their stuff in a real clan war. This war is casual and geared towards learning and improving. If you show that you are putting forward the effort and resources in your war attacks, you will be eligible for our Friday war.</p>

  <h1>Competitive War (Friday 6:00pm CDT):</h1>
  <p> Anyone who shown that they are comfortable using <a href="/resources.html"> 3-star strategies</a> during the Tuesday war will be included for our Competitive war. This war is a little bit more serious and we hold ourselves to higher standards. To be eligible, you must: <br /> 
    1) Be opted-in <br />
    2) Have been in at least one war with us <br />
    3) Shown the effort to use <a href="/resources.html"> 3-star strategies</a> in the previous Tuesday war. <br />
    <br />
    The Friday war is a chance to get your fix of competitive warring. Getting the win is the main objective here. Wondering what a <a href="/resources.html"> 3-star strategie</a> means? Check out our resources to help you get caught up to speed with war tactics!</p>

<div id="section3" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Rules</h1>
  <p>There's only two hard rules that will result in being kicked from the clan.
<br />
1) Must use both attacks in the war (no exceptions)<br />
2) No attacking solely for the War Loot Bonus (no exceptions)<br />
<br />
If you break these rules you find yourself kicked. Worry not, we will give you a second chance if asked. (You must wait for the 24-hr cooldown before you can request back in)</p>

<div id="section41" class="container-fluid">
  <h1>Guidelines</h1>
  <ul>
<li>Do not worry about contributing to the defensive Clan Castles. Arrangements have already been made to ensure they get filled.</li>

<li>Try to attack the highest base that you are comfortable 3-starring.</li>

<li>If all of the bases that you are comfortable 3-starring are attacked, make a practice attack on a defeated base. Attacking for loot is not allowed.</li>

<li>Ask for questions or advice if you want an opinion before your war attack.</li>

<li>Don't forget to request for troops before you attack.</li>

<li>Check out our  <a href="/resources.html">resources page</a>  <a href="/resources.html"> for clan war tips and videos!</a></li></p>
